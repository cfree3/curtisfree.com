Did you know that you can include (at least some) HTML in your Blogger title?

Simply enter the HTML along with your normal text.

For example, my title is:

    <a href="http://curtisfree.com">CurtisFree.com</a> <a href="http://blog.curtisfree.com">Blog</a>

Note, however, that if all of the printable characters in your title are links, you'll have to
use the links _below_ it in the blog list to go to its settings (as the usually-clickable title
will have your links).

##### _Update (24 Sep 2011)_

While this tip still works:

  1. I don't use [Blogger][blogger] anymore; I use [jekyll][jekyll].
  2. The mention of links in the Blogger UI is probably no longer accurate.

[blogger]: http://blogger.com
[jekyll]:  http://jekyllrb.com
