title:  Binary "Priority Inbox" in Microsoft Outlook

[Gmail](https://mail.google.com)'s "Priority Inbox" feature allows a user to separate messages in
his/her inbox into multiple categories based on message attributes.

I use a simple inbox configuration in Gmail. In Google's terms:

  1. Important and unread
  2. Unread
  3. Starred
  4. Everything else

Perhaps most importantly, among read messages, starred messages are presented above unstarred
messages. I use a star to indicate that I need to take further action on an email at some point. The
Exchange/Outlook alternative to starring a message is to "flag" it for follow-up.

To establish a simplistic "priority inbox" in Outlook, then, one needs to sort the inbox into two
groups: flagged and unflagged. Outlook doesn't offer this organization as a predined option; but
it's not difficult to set one up.

To do so, click the message list _Arrange By_ header, go to _Custom Arrangements_, and choose _Edit
Custom Arrangements._ Then, click _New_ and give your arrangement a name. Here are the settings I
use to mimic _Priority Inbox_:
