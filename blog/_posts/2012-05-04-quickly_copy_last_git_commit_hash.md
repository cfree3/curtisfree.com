title:  Quickly copy last Git commit hash
layout: post
---
A typical portion of my Git workflow involves the following:

  1. Local `git commit`
  2. `git push` to upstream remote
  3. Add a comment to an issue tracker that includes the new commit hash

A simple shell (ZSH, BASH, or similar) function makes the last step a little bit easier:

    gitcp() { git log -1 --format="%H" | xclip -in; }

After running `gitcp`, the hash of the last commit is in X's primary selection and can easily be
pasted into a comment box in the issue tracker.

Depending on your preferences, you can [instruct `xclip`][xclip] to copy into a different X
"selection" -- or you can even use [Autocutsel][autocutsel] to sync your X selections.

Not using X11? There are [`xclip` alternatives][xclip_alt] for OS X and Windows, so you can spin up
your own helper utility.
